# ABOUT

- I decided to take on this project when I realised I had nothing better to do over the summer
- I wanted to make use of skills I learnt while building a different device for a school competition which was a satellite in the size of a can
- I learnt to solder better, code better on the Raspberry Pi platform and design a PCB
- RC models and boats have always interested me, so I decided to combine the two to create HMS Byte Size
- The system will operate on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, communicating over 2.4GHz RF with a secondary Pi which will control the boat remotely
- I wasn't too confident with SMD and lacking a hot plate or any SMD capability, I decided to go with all through hole components

_LED will power to confirm the board is running_

_Careful planning of how to power such project took place and resulted in numerous de-coupling capacitors, and others to manage current spikes and back-EMI_

_2-layer PCB composed of all through hole components, will full layer ground pours, and via stitching_

## Costs
It's looking rather costly

I've tried to stick to amazon and ali express for cheap components, but obviously I have doubts about reliability and whatnot.

Things like resistors and capacitors through MouserUK and RapidElectronics

## BOM


It's a bit messy, I just add as I go. All accurate though
