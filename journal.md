## Saturday 7th June
Parts list finalised and BOM updated.

Total cost far exceeds what I was hoping. Let's hope it works





## Tuesday 17th June
Finalising my PCB design to accommodate the Pi Zero 2W, nRF module and other parts

I've had to learn about capacitors and where to use them to improve the longevity and reliability of my RC boat. 

Experimented with ground planes and I think I've figured that out to avoid ground loops

_Almost finished PCB_

Now I need to begin CAD to build accommodation for all the components.
