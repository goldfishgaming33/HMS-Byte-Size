- Time spent is cumulative 

## Saturday 7th June
Parts list finalised and BOM updated.

Total cost far exceeds what I was hoping. Let's hope it works

Time spent: 2 hours


## Tuesday 17th June
Finalising my PCB design to accommodate the Pi Zero 2W, nRF module and other parts

I've had to learn about capacitors and where to use them to improve the longevity and reliability of my RC boat. 

Experimented with ground planes and I think I've figured that out to avoid ground loops

_Almost finished PCB_

Now I need to begin CAD to build accommodation for all the components.

Time spend: 5 hours

## Wednesday 18th June
Added a readme and BOM together in one file. I reviewed a couple of other projects on the highway to see why people are being rejected, and hopefully I'm going to avoid that!

Asked a friend for some advice and made amends to my PCB, namely adding a resistor for me LED, and populating 3D models. Also, I had to basically re-do the PCB design because one of the footprints I was using was wrong...

_Pretty sure it's finished now_

_Populated 3D model_

Time spent: 8 hours

## Saturday 21st and Sunday 22nd June
Basically taught myself CAD. Designs on the way.

## Monday 23rd June
My CAD model is beginning to take shape.

Time spent 9.5 hours

## Tuesday 24th June
developed the CAD model further. I need to figure out how to add mounts inside the hull for the components, and how to create a lid to seal it all in.

Time spent 10.5 hours

## Wednesday 25th June
Finished up the CAD model with the parts. Ready for submission!
